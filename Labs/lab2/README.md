# Lab2: Qiskit - Introduction

![Qiskit](qiskit-banner.png)

## 1 - Objectives

* Getting to know Qiskit platform.
* Getting to know how to use Google Colaboratory.
* Learning to build and run quantum circuits on classical simulators.

## 2 - Introduction to Qiskit

Qiskit is an open-source software for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms. Additionally, several domain specific application APIâ€™s exist on top of this core module.

The central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers, regardless of their skill level or area of interest.

Qiskit allows one to easily design experiments and applications and run them on real quantum computers and/or classical simulators.

To install qiskit on your local machine, please follow the instructions provided [here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html#installation).

## 3 - Qiskit Tutorials

Please start by checking the following tutorials:

* [Introduction to Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/intro_tutorial1.html)
* [Circuit Basics](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/01_circuit_basics.html)
* [Summary of Quantum Operations](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/3_summary_of_quantum_operations.html)

## 4 - Introduction to Colaboratory

* Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.
* You can get all the information you need about how to use Colaboratory from this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).

## 5 - Requirements

* Solve [this notebook](lab2.ipynb) of the assignment and deliver a filled ipython notebook that shows the outputs of the different circuits.
* Answer the provided questions in the lab, via the submission form.

## Notes

* Qiskit uses the least significant bits order (from right to left), i.e. the first qubit is the one to the rightmost.
